                              <p>Even though you are not eligible for sealing your criminal record, it is now against the law for an employer to ask you about your criminal record before they have provided you a conditional offer of employment. In 2014, The District of Columbia passed a law that prohibits employers (with 11 or more employees) from having a criminal background questions on a job application form, and ALSO prohibits an employer from asking about criminal convictions, arrests or accusations until after a conditional offer of employment has been made.</p> 

            <p>If someone ask you about your criminal history (before giving you a conditional offer) or if there is a question on the job application about your criminal history, you should immediatly file a complaint with the DC Office of Human Rights (OHR) <a href="http://ohr.dc.gov/page/returningcitizens">here</a> Compensation may be available to you if it is found that an employer you applied for a job with asked about your criminal history before making a condition offer of employment OR if they have a question on their employment application that asks if you have every committed a crime or been arrested.</p>
